# Capstone Project

## Project Title
Customer Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI to analyze customer data, focusing on subscription trends, cancellations, and overall performance metrics. The integration of these tools allows for comprehensive data manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

## Data Source
Incubator Hub, Capstone Project

##Tools Used
- **Excel**: For initial data processing and exploratory analysis[Download here](https://www.microsoft word)
- **SQL Server**: For data storage, transformation, and management.[Download here](https://www.microsoft word)
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.[Download here][Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
- **Github for Portfolio Building
  
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
-**Standardize Data Formats**:Remove or impute as needed
-**Calculate Derived Columns**: Add SubscriptionDuration
-**Validate Data Consistency**: Check for negative revenues, date inconsistencies, and ensure positive subscription durations.

## Data Analysis 
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.
- `Region`: Geographic region of the customer.
- `SubscriptionType`: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- `SubscriptionStart`: Start date of the subscription.
- `SubscriptionEnd`: End date of the subscription.
- `Canceled`: Indicates whether the subscription was canceled (TRUE/FALSE).
- `Revenue`: Revenue generated from the subscription.

### Excel
- Analyzed customer data using pivot Tables
- calculated average subscription duration and identified most popular subscription type

### 1. SQL Server Setup 
- **Import Data**:
  - Imported the customer dataset into the created database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
  
```sql
-- Example SQL script to create a database
CREATE DATABASE CustomerData;
```
## Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Visualizes the distribution of customers by subscription type and region.
- **Cancellations Analysis**: Displays the proportion of canceled versus active subscriptions.
- **Subscription Trends**: Illustrates monthly trends in new subscriptions over time.
- **Revenue Insights**: Summarizes total revenue generated by different subscription types.
- **Interactive Slicers**: Allows users to filter data dynamically based on regions, subscription types, and cancellation status.

## PowerBI
- **Created Dashboard showing**:
    - Count Of Customers
    - **Canceled vs Active**: Cancled by Customer ID
    - **Subscription Trends**: Subscription Starts by Customer ID 
    - **Revenue Analysis**: Total Revenue by Subscription
